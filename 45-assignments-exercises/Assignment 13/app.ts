//13. Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car,
// and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items,
// such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

const favTransport: string[] = ["Motor Cycle", "Sports Car", "Horse"];
// stored names of transport in a array

console.log("I would like to ride a " + favTransport[0] + "."); // print message
console.log("I would like to own a " + favTransport[1] + "."); // print message
console.log("I would like to ride a " + favTransport[2] + "."); // print message
